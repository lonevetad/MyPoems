# MyPoems
Yes, poems; since the "complex drafts" project is not done yet. All poetries I've done, plus new ones in branches.

## Structure
Two major folders are presented: "poems" and "programs".
The former contains all current potery projects.
The latter contains all coding projecs, like the server storing all projects notes, the webpage to edit them and the mobile app for edits as well.

### Poems
Each poetry project lives inside a folder with the same name.
The structure is the following ones (last update: 19/02/2025).
A file "txt" (currently) with the same name is generated to contain the final version, ready to be published.
Similarly, a file whose name is the same except for the suffix "__w_notes" contains both the final version and the words/verses commentaries.
Then, all possible other source materials might be added. Usually, concepts like the main idea, the beginning, the ending, each in-between parts, characters, bigger metaphores, etc., could be stored in each separate file. There's no general direction to be followed, at the moment (19/02/2025). Possibly, each stanza could be developed in a separated file, whose name is the stanza's number only.

### Programs

Different systems could be designed to handle my projects.
A server holding all the raw poetries, or the structured projects; a website or a mobile app to edit them.
